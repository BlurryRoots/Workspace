# Workspace

## Preamble

This is my Workspace. There are many like it but this one is mine. My Workspace is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my Workspace is useless. Without my Workspace I am useless. I must code in my Workspace true. I must code more l33t than my enemy, who is trying to pwn me. I must code it before he codes it. I will. Before HAL I swear this creed: my Workspace and myself are defenders of $random_stuff, we are the masters of my enemy, we are the saviors of my life. So be it, until there is no enemy, but peace. Live long and prosper.
(If you got the reference, take a :cookie:)

## Setup
Setup stuff in ```Config/dotfiles``` then define the location of the workspace in ```Config/oninit``` via ```$CONFIGURATION_PATH``` and finally run ```source <some path>/Workspace/Config/oninit```. This will link all the configuration files.
